# Dragonbreak

**A Wabbajack Modlist by Camora**

---

## Overview

**Dragonbreak** is a modlist that fundamentally re-envisions Skyrim with old-school styled RPG Mechanics. In active development!

---

## Requirements

### Supported Game Version

- **Skyrim Special Edition (Steam, English only)**
- **Version 1.6.1170 required**
- **Anniversary Edition (AE) upgrade required**
- **Creation Kit (Steam) must be installed and launched once**

## Installation

### Pre-Installation Setup

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and [.NET Runtime 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer)
2. Set Skyrim to **not auto-update** in Steam
3. Launch Skyrim once to download all AE content (**do not alt-tab or verify files**)
4. If errors occur, delete all `cc*.esl` files from the `Data` folder and relaunch
5. Install and launch the **Creation Kit** at least once via Steam

### Wabbajack Installation

1. Download [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and extract it to a path like `C:\Games\Wabbajack`
2. Open Wabbajack, browse modlists, and download **Dragonbreak**
3. Set your install location (e.g. `C:\Dragonbreak`, not your desktop/downloads)
4. Click play and let Wabbajack handle the rest

## Troubleshooting

- **File download errors** – Retry or manually download to the correct location  
- **AE/CC content missing** – Ensure all official content is downloaded  
- **Whitelist errors** – Wait for modlist update or check for announcements  
- **Antivirus false positives** – Exclude your `Mod Organizer` folder in Windows Defender

1. Open `ModOrganizer.exe` from the Dragonbreak install folder
2. Select **Dragonbreak** from the profile dropdown
3. Click `Run` to launch the game
