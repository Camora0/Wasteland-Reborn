### Adjustments
Changelog for 0.6.0

Not Save Safe

+ Anom's Sanctuary Overhaul has been removed due to compatability issues. While I love the look of the overhaul, the number of worldspace and cell edits it makes is prohibitive to patching.

+ Rebuilt LODs.

+ Reverted Classic Holstered Weapons to 1.04c as it has better compatability with modded weapons.

+ Fixed N99 10mm Pistol's name for consistency.

+ Fixed Grease Gun INNRs

+ Fixed .22 SMG INNRs

+ Fixed 7.62 Tokarev improperly spawning.

+ Fixed Laser Musket firing sound

+ Added injections into safes and suitcases for a variety of small arms.

+ Fixed .223 from incorrectly being injected in game. (No Weapons use it).

+ Removed injection for the F4NV AMR, they now correctly are semi-uniques.

+ Adjusted Police 10mm revolver/pistols to appear at level 9.

+ The Minigun at the Museum of Freedom now only gives one magazine worth of ammo (500 Rounds).

+ Updated Workshop Framework.

+ Ballistic weapon skills once again contribute to weapon damage. 

+ The Sun now sets at a more accurate time.

+ Rebalanced Base Health, Base Carry Weight, and Base AP. At 5 in all special stats, the player character should have 100 in those three stats.

+ Replaced the Rangemaster with Jkruse's Version > https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41727

+ Replaced SPARS with Power Armor To The People > https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/50819

+ Replaced the F3 10mm with the FO76 10mm > https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/77200	

+ Fixed an issue where things added by Grilled Turkey's creature mods would be appear twice.

### Removals

+ Removed Craftable Armor, Clothing, and Power Armor, as they were redundant. In the future, I will apply You Are Exceptional's Perk requirements to craft all crafting recipes in the game.

+ Removed Infiltrator - Lockpicking Overhaul. Currently redundant with You are Exceptional.

+ Removed M1 Carbine and its' dependencies. While the weapon itself is lore-friendly, the mod's attachments are far from it. Also, it unneccesarily uses a popup to inject its' instances into Leveled Lists.

+ Pipe Weapons are no more! All instances of Pipe Bolt Actions, Pipe Guns, and Pipe Revolvers have now been replaced with better-designed alternatives.

+ Removed Famished. They had unfixable AI bugs.

+ Removed Varied Diamond City Faces and randomized Diamond City Guard Armors. Redundant now.

+ Removed Puddle Fix, It actually *causes* puddle issues with the ENB enabled.

+ Replaced Deadpool2099s 9mm pistol with Alexerator's 9mm pistol > https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/74140

+ Removed True Damage, Replaced it with Dak's Ammo Rebalance > https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/77613
