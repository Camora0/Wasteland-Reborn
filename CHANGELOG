+ Fixed an issue where male NPCs could spawn with an item that lacked a model for them.

+ Removed the Super Mutant injection for the Assault Shotgun and Handmade Rocket Rifle, as it had the side effect of breaking the weapon for everyone else. This will cause a popup on an existing save, but it's safe.

+ Expanded the outfit overhaul to a few NPCs I'd missed the first time around.

+ Reduced the rate that Marine Armor spawns in Combat Armor Leveled lists.

+ Should have fixed a problem with a group of Raiders spawning in Nuka World with no AI.

Changelog for 0.9.51

Save Safe

+ Significantly nerfed the Desert Raiders armors so that they can be used as underarmor (as they function as underarmor).

Changelog for 0.9.5

Not Save Safe

+ Prevented the .22 Auto Revolver from being injected into Leveled lists, as I personally found it aesthetically inconsistent with the rest of the weapons.

+ Reworked the ENB to improve visuals and reduce unnecessary effects.

+ Fixed a majority of the Capital wasteland dresses so they now have underwear on female models.

+ Gunners' Ranks are now more clearly communicated through their uniform.

+ Improved the BoS Uniform Leveled Lists.

+ Added a custom main menu screen with five random songs!

+ Created a custom CBBE preset to improve the body shape (Particularly the shoulders) from the vanilla preset.

+ Renamed the White Glove Society Attire to "High-Class Gambler Attire" so it may be usable in general leveled lists.

+ Reworked the Outfit system for the majority of generic clothing in the game. Now, outfits will be drawn from a leveled list of similar items from a variety of the mods included in the modlist. This is done to increase the visual variety of NPCs. This implementation is through direct outfit and leveled list edits, so any added mods that further edit the outfits would need to either be loaded after the master patch or be allowed to work somewhat improperly.

+ There are now two choices for ENB. One for those who prefer a more vibrant look and one for a more classic look.

+ Fixed a bug where some players would experience an infinite load screen during startup of a new game.

+ Capped the framerate at 120.

+ Fixed a duplication glitch involving Exceedingly Rare Scrap.

+ Adjusted the crRangedDmgPerk applied to turrets and other enemies in an attempt to make them not as powerful.

+ Removed Dak's Tire and Wood Armor from Legendary LLs.

+ Made Radiation from the Glowing Sea and the Fog stronger.

+ Changed the sound of the Defense rifle to be louder and feel more powerful.

+ Nerfed Pig Rat melee damage to be *significantly* weaker. They are now ~50% stronger than the average mole rat of similar level.

+ Nerfed the DPS of the DOT used by the Small Starving Stinkbug.

+ Added a fix for the inability to go to Point Lookout due to Companions into the optional section, for those that are experiencing it.

+ ESLified many plugins to make space for user-selected mods. This will be standard practice going forward, and may cause possible bugs if adding tweaks to mods that are already in the list. Consult me if you need help.
