## Summary

A full, bottom up redesign of Fallout 4. Over 730 handpicked mods to transform Fallout 4 into the game it could have been. A whole new leveling system, new quests and locations, and hundreds of new weapons and armors to bring the design of Fallout 3 and New Vegas into the Commonwealth.Â

<summary><h2>Installation</h2></summary>

### Pre-Installation

Do note that you MUST use ***FULL (ALL DLC, except high-res textures) LATEST*** Steam version of Fallout 4 because we've said so. Not up for debates.

These steps are only needed if you are installing Wasteland Reborn for the first time.

#### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

You most likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2, and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if the other link doesn't work.

#### Turn off Steam updates

To turn off Steam automatically updating the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

**This game does use a Stock Game Folder, so it should be fine in the event of an update, but it is still best practice to turn it off.**

#### Cleaning Fallout 4

It is highly recommended to uninstall the game through Steam, delete the game folder, and reinstall it. It is also recommended to delete the `Fallout4` folder in `Documents/My Games/`.

#### Starting Fallout 4

After you have done everything above and have a clean Fallout 4 game folder, start the Launcher and let it do the initial graphics check. Do not worry about this part, as the installation will replace these graphics settings, then Start Fallout 4. 

Once the Main Menu has loaded you may exit. After doing this, do not play Fallout 4 again using the Launcher, as it will revert your .ini files and could mess up your settings.

### Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Download the latest version of Wabbajack [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a folder. This folder **must not** be in your Desktop, Downloads, or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder at the root level, like `C:/Wabbajack.`

#### Download and Installation

The download and installation of Wasteland Reborn process may take a long time, depending on your system. To speed up this process it is advised to place the working folder on an SSD.

1. Open Wabbajack.
2. Click `Browse Modlists` then click the dropdown menu on top and select `Fallout 4` (don't forget to tick `Show Unofficial Lists`), and download Wasteland Reborn from the Modlist Gallery.
3. Set your download and installation paths. The recommended Installation Path is a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as C:\Wasteland Reborn. The download path will update automatically. There's an option to put the download folder on another drive, for example an HDD, while the instance stays on an SSD.
5. Then click the Go/Begin button.
6. Wait for Wabbajack to finish. It may take awhile, depending on your internet speed and if you are using an SSD or HDD.

While this is happening, the developer team suggests to download the mods that ***WILL*** cause issues later down the line if one does not download them before the end of the download phase *(these are linked below)*.

#### Problems with Wabbajack

If you run into download issues with Wabbajack, it is recommended to re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off, so you will not have to start over.

#### Could not download...

If you have issues with files not downloading, manually download the files and drop them inside of the Download folder, then re-run Wabbajack. Once Wabbajack detects the missing and failed to download files it will finish the setup process.

Current files known to have issues:
1. [Colt Single Action Army - F4NV Discord](https://discord.com/invite/f4nv) 
2. [Anti-Material Rifle - F4NV Discord](https://discord.com/invite/f4nv)

You must join the F4NV Discord in order to download the AMR and CSAA files. Once you have joined, go to the ***--F4NV NEWS--*** tab and click on ***released-F4NV-content***. Then scroll up until you find those two files. They are located right under the **.45 Auto Pistol (Colt M1911)** mod.

### Modifying INIs

To ensure the proper settings are enabled, you need to run Bethini. Launch it through the dropdown menu in Mod Organizer 2.. 

#### Setting BethINI Pie up incase it is not set up automatically:
1. Set the Game Path to: "(Your install folder)\Stock Game and make sure to select ***Fallout4.exe***";
2. Set the INI Path to: "(Your install folder)\profiles\Wasteland Reborn";
3. Use the Restore Backup if you want to use your backed up INIs again. 

#### While Bethini is open, change the following settings, if they are not already set up:
+ Change the resolution of the game (I use a 1440p monitor, and the inis are set as such.) , display mode (default should be set and left at Borderless Windowed);
+ Set the presets to Bethini Presets, and press the High button.
+ Apply the recommended tweaks as well. Then save your settings.

### Saving on disk space ***(Highly OPTIONAL)***

After a successful download deleting the ***downloads*** folder's content is safe. 
Note: If the user does end up cleaning the folder, a redownload ***WILL*** be in order if they do end up deciding to update. As the modpack in the very first phase (open beta) expect to be bombarded with updates of any caliber.

### How to start up Wasteland Reborn

Head over to the installation folder, locate the .exe file `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once it launches, there will be a drop-down box on the upper right and a big run button right next to it. Ensure it is set to `F4SE` select it in the drop-down box, and then click the run button which. You have to run `F4SE` through Mod Organizer 2 in order to load the mods correctly as Mod Organizer handles some mods via VFS (Virtual File System).

After making a new character in a new game, you will be immediately prompted to set your name and special stats. After this, select yes on the pop up asking about workshop setups, as this list needs extra time to initialize its scripts.

Shortly after, you will be teleported to the top of the Vault 111 entrance.

After this, you'll want to set up your MCM settings. 

### IT IS IMPERATIVE YOU SET THESE UP TO GET THE INTENDED PLAY EXPERIENCE

First, in the start menu, navigate to the MCM settings menu. Then click on the dropdown titled "MCM Settings", and then "MCM Settings Manager". Press Apply on the preset. Afterwards, you'll need to exit back into the game to select yes on a pop up regarding Legendary effects. Select yes on that pop up, then go back to the MCM settings manager and apply the rest of the settings. 

Once this is done, Save and load your game, and you're good to go!

<summary><h2>Updating the list</h2></summary>

If Wasteland Reborn receives an update, please check the Changelog before doing anything.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that if you added any of your own mods into the Modlist, they will be deleted. In the future we will provide details on how to prevent files from being deleted once the most common issues are fixes.

Updating is like installing the modlist. You only have to make sure that you select the same paths and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button (typically Wabbajack already selects the folders but it is recommended to make sure they're correct before continuing).
