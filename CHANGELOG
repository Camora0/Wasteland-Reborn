Save Safe

+ Fixed certain noteable weapons to use Rockets from Munitions, as there are now sufficiently enough to justify it.

Changelog for 0.6.0

Not Save Safe

+ Anom's Sanctuary Overhaul has been removed due to compatability issues. While I love the look of the overhaul, the number of worldspace and cell edits it makes is prohibitive to patching.

+ Rebuilt LODs.

+ Reverted Classic Holstered Weapons to 1.04c as it has better compatability with modded weapons.

+ Fixed N99 10mm Pistol's name for consistency.

+ Fixed Grease Gun INNRs

+ Pipe Weapons are no more! All instances of Pipe Bolt Actions, Pipe Guns, and Pipe Revolvers have now been replaced with better-designed alternatives.

+ Removed Famished. They had unfixable AI bugs.

+ Removed Varied Diamond City Faces and randomized Diamond City Guard Armors. Redundant now.

+ Fixed .223 from incorrectly being injected in game. (No Weapons use it).

+ Removed injection for the F4NV AMR, they now correctly are semi-uniques.

+ Adjusted Police 10mm revolver/pistols to appear at level 9.

+ The Minigun at the Museum of Freedom now only gives one magazine worth of ammo (500 Rounds).

+ Updated Workshop Framework.

+ Ballistic weapon skills once again contribute to weapon damage. 

+ The Sun now sets at a more accurate time.

+ Rebalanced Base Health, Base Carry Weight, and Base AP. At 5 in all special stats, the player character should have 100 in those three stats.

+ Total Starting Special Points is now set to 35, Down from 40. This is to make character creation be more consequential to the early game experience.
