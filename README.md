# Wasteland Reborn

## Summary

A full, bottom up redesign of Fallout 4. Over 650 handpicked mods to transform Fallout 4 into the game it could have been. A whole new leveling system, new quests and locations, and hundreds of new weapons and armors to bring the design of Fallout 3 and New Vegas into the Commonwealth. 

## Installation

### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you are installing Wasteland Reborn for the first time.

#### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

You most likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2, and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if the other link doesn't work.

#### Turn off Steam updates

Bethesda is planning a Next-Gen update soon, and who knows how often it will be updated after that, since they are talking about introducing the Creation store. Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for a short bit, because some mods need to be updated to the latest game version.

To turn off Steam automatically updating the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

**This game does use a Stock Folder, so it should be fine in the event of an update, but it is still best practice to turn it off.**

#### Cleaning Fallout 4

It is highly recommended to uninstall the game through Steam, delete the game folder, and reinstall it. It is also recommended to delete the `Fallout4` folder in `Documents/My Games/`.

#### Starting Fallout 4

After you have done everything above and have a clean Fallout 4 game folder, start the Launcher and let it do the initial graphics check. Do not worry about this part, as the installation will replace these graphics settings, then Start Fallout 4. 

Once the Main Menu has loaded you may exit. After doing this, do not play Fallout 4 again using the Launcher, as it will revert your .ini files and could mess up your settings.

### Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Download the latest version of Wabbajack [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a folder. This folder **must not** be in your Desktop, Downloads, or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder at the root level, like `C:/Wabbajack.`

#### Download and Installation

The download and installation of Wasteland Reborn process may take a long time, depending on your system. To speed up this process it is advised to place the working folder on an SSD.

1. Open Wabbajack.
2. Click `browse modlists` then click the dropdown menu on top and select `Fallout 4` (don't forget to tick show `unofficial lists`), and download Wasteland Reborn from the Modlist Gallery.
3. Set your download and installation paths. The recommended Installation Path is a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as C:\Wasteland Reborn. The Download Path will update automatically. You may also put the download folder on another drive. Such as, install the game on an SSD, but put the download folder on a HDD. Then you save space on your SSD.
5. Then click the Go/Begin button.
6. Wait for Wabbajack to finish. It may take awhile, depending on your internet speed and if you are using and SSD or HDD.

#### Problems with Wabbajack

If you run into download issues with Wabbajack, it is recommended to re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off, so you will not have to start over.

#### Could not download...

If you have issues with files not downloading, manually download the files and drop them inside of the Download folder, then re-run Wabbajack. Once Wabbajack detects the proper files it will finish the setup process.

2. [Colt Single Action Army - F4NV Discord](http://discord.gg/f4nv) 
3. [Anti-Material Rifle - F4NV Discord](http://discord.gg/f4nv)

Then scroll up until you find those two files. They are located right under the **.45 Auto Pistol (Colt M1911)** mod.

## After Installation

### How to start up Wasteland Reborn

You have to run [F4SE]. through Mod Organizer 2 in order to play Wasteland Reborn without messing up your settings from now on.

### Updating the modlist

If Wasteland Reborn receives an update, please check the Changelog before doing anything.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

Updating is like installing the modlist. You only have to make sure that you select the same paths and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.
